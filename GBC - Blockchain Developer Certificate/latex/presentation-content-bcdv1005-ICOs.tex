    \center\Huge  Elements of a white paper
}

\subsection{Criteria}

\frame{ 
	\frametitle{General considerations}
    \begin{alertblock}{Be careful with your money}
    Any investment requires due diligence. Ask yourself what the investor gets for his/her money?
    \end{alertblock}

    \begin{alertblock}{Guarantees}
    How confident are you the team will complete its end of the bargain? What are the available recourse when they do not?
    \end{alertblock}

    \begin{alertblock}{Compliance}
    Is this legal? What are the risks and the administrative burden on the investor side?
    % example: illegal trafficking of substances, duty to report to CRA and other regulators
    \end{alertblock}

}


\frame{ 
	\frametitle{Team}
    \begin{itemize}
        \item Do these people exist?
        \item Do their roles and credentials match the domain of expertise?
        \item Did they agree to be featured? 
        \item How much are they involved in the project? (100\% time -- 0.001\% time?)
        \item Are they credible? Can they pull it off?
        \item Which company is backing this project (if any)?
    \end{itemize}
}

\frame{ 
	\frametitle{Project}
    \begin{itemize}
        \item Does it have any kind of business or social value? 
        \item What is the business model (including token economics)?
        \item Is it achievable? (There should be a sensical roadmap)
        \item How much research and development has already been done so far?
        \item How many users are currently using the system (if any)? (is there a MVP?)
    \end{itemize}
}

\frame{ 
	\frametitle{Technology}
    \begin{itemize}
        \item Why do we need Blockchain for that?
        \item Is Blockchain (and other) technology used apropriately?
% a study from UBC shows that half of the projects don't need a blockchain https://editorialexpress.com/cgi-bin/conference/download.cgi?db_name=CICF2019&paper_id=1043
        \item What is the underlying Blockchain platform? (e.g. Ethereum, Waves)
        \item How are the engineering constraints addressed? (e.g. throughput in tps, scalability, saturation, cost of transactions, interoperability)
        \item How maintainable and sustainable the solution is?
        \item What is the approach to ensure an acceptable level of security?
    \end{itemize}
}

\frame{ 
	\frametitle{Governance and Use of the proceeds}
    \begin{itemize}
        \item What does the team plan to do with the funds?
        \item What is the governance model?
        \item What's in there for the investor?
        \item Is the financial model realistic?
        \item Are legal and compliance risks thorougly assessed and discussed?
    \end{itemize}
}

\frame{ 
	\frametitle{ICO process}
    \begin{itemize}
        \item How is the token issued? (e.g. through an exchange)
        \item Are all investors treated fairly? (e.g. similar value/risk ratio, unreasonable pre-sale discounts to a certain class of investors)
        \item Do the founders have an unfair advantage? (e.g. control)
        \item Is the ICO backed to some level by regulators? (e.g. the OSC in Ontario can issue exemption letters, SEC in the US)
        \item What does the crypto-community say? (e.g. coverage in journals, podcasts, Youtube, Reddit, etc)
    \end{itemize}
