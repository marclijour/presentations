	abstract = {The financial crisis of 2008 aroused widespread interest in banking and financial history among policy makers, academics, journalists, and even bankers, in addition to the wider public. References in the press to the term 'Great Depression' spiked after the failure of Lehman Brothers in November 2008, with similar surges in references to 'economic history' at various times during the financial turbulence.

In an attempt to better understand the magnitude of the shock, there was a demand for historical parallels. How severe was the financial crash? Was it, in fact, the most severe financial crisis since the Great Depression? Were its causes unique or part of a well-known historical pattern? And have financial crises always led to severe depressions?

Historical reflection on the recent financial crises and the long-term development of the financial system go hand in hand. This volume provides the material for such a reflection by presenting the state of the art in banking and financial history. Nineteen highly regarded experts present chapters on the economic and financial side of banking and financial activities, primarily though not solely in advanced economies, in a long-term comparative perspective. In addition to paying attention to
general issues, not least those related to theoretical and methodological aspects of the discipline, the volume approaches the banking and financial world from four distinct but interrelated angles: financial institutions, financial markets, financial regulation, and financial crises.},

For both observations, the model’s ability to provide a rich analysis depends on little more than the ingredients implicit in the absence-of-double-coincidence view.

We argue that the financial disruptions of 1930-33 reduced the efficiency of the credit allocation process; and that the resulting higher cost and reduced availability of credit acted to depress aggregate demand.

Digital signatures provide part of the solution, but the main benefits are lost if a trusted third party is still required to prevent double-spending. We propose a solution to the double-spending problem using a peer-to-peer network. The network timestamps transactions by hashing them into an ongoing chain of hash-based proof-of-work, forming a record that cannot be changed without redoing the proof-of-work. The longest chain not only serves as proof of the sequence of events witnessed, but proof that it came from the largest pool of CPU power. As long as a majority of CPU power is controlled by nodes that are not cooperating to attack the network, they'll generate the longest chain and outpace attackers. The network itself requires minimal structure. Messages are broadcast on a best effort basis, and nodes can leave and rejoin the network at will, accepting the longest proof-of-work chain as proof of what happened while they were gone.},

In fact, it is only the best-known recent experiment in a long line of similar efforts going back to the 1970s. But the story behind cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin and its blockchain technology has largely been untold—until now. In Digital Cash, Finn Brunton reveals how technological utopians and political radicals created experimental money to bring about their visions of the future: protecting privacy or bringing down governments, preparing for apocalypse or launching a civilization of innovation and abundance that would make its creators immortal.The incredible story of the pioneers of cryptocurrency takes us from autonomous zones on the high seas to the world’s most valuable dump, from bank runs to idea coupons, from time travelers in a San Francisco bar to the pattern securing every twenty-dollar bill, and from marketplaces for dangerous secrets to a tank of frozen heads awaiting revival in the far future. Along the way, Digital Cash explores the hard questions and challenges that these innovators faced: How do we learn to trust and use different kinds of money? What makes digital objects valuable? How does currency prove itself as real to us? What would it take to make a digital equivalent to cash, something that could be created but not forged, exchanged but not copied, and which reveals nothing about its users?Filled with marvelous characters, stories, and ideas, Digital Cash is an engaging and accessible account of the strange origins and remarkable technologies behind today’s cryptocurrency explosion.},

	abstract = {In this thesis we explore the implications of technology innovation across the areas of settlement finality, cross border payments and money.

As a first step, we investigate the topic of settlement finality in the context of Proof-of-Work (PoW) blockchains, exemplified by Bitcoin. This is of particular importance as final settlement plays a crucial role in removing settlement risk between counterparties in support of financial stability. We extend earlier work in Berndsen (2013) on functional modelling of the theoretical settlement problem. By applying his model we provide a functional interpretation of settlement finality and propose a new encompassing definition of settlement finality, which expands the academic field of payment economics. We also assess whether PoW is functionally superior to the backward looking legal framework for settlement finality.

In a second step we explore whether and how technological innovation, in conjunction with policy measures, can improve the process of correspondent banking cross-border payments. Following the empirical validation of existing shortcomings by using a questionnaire and industry expert focus group sessions, we identify key requirements based on which we develop several design scenarios for the future of cross-border payments. We then evaluate the different models and complement our findings with policy and standards recommendations, outlining a practical way forward for the industry.

Finally we explore an alternative perspective on the future role of central bank money as a retail use digital complement to physical cash. Against a set of future scenarios we develop the rationale for a Eurosystem issued ‘Digital Euro’ and proceed by delivering a high level blueprint for the design of such a solution. As retail cash payments move into the digital age with the associated challenges for citizens’ data, identity as well as financial stability and system security, such a step will become an increasingly relevant consideration for the Eurosystem.},

Although Ripple holds the second highest market cap after Bitcoin, there are surprisingly no studies which analyze the provisions of Ripple.In this paper, we study the current deployment of the Ripple payment system. For that purpose, we overview the Ripple protocol and outline its security and privacy provisions in relation to the Bitcoin system. We also discuss the consensus protocol of Ripple. Contrary to the statement of the Ripple designers, we show that the current choice of parameters does not prevent the occurrence of forks in the system. To remedy this problem, we give a necessary and sufficient condition to prevent any fork in the system. Finally, we analyze the current usage patterns and trade dynamics in Ripple by extracting information from the Ripple global ledger. As far as we are aware, this is the first contribution which sheds light on the current deployment of the Ripple system.},

	url = {https://plato.stanford.edu/archives/win2018/entries/money-finance/},
	abstract = {Finance and philosophy may seem to be worlds apart. But they share atleast one common ancestor: Thales of Miletus. Thales is typicallyregarded as the first philosopher, but he was also a financialinnovator. He appears to have been what we would now call an optiontrader. He predicted that next year’s olive harvest would begood, and therefore paid a small amount of money to the owners ofolive presses for the right to the next year’s use. When theharvest turned out to be as good as predicted, Thales earned a sizableamount of money by renting out the presses (Aristotle,Politics, 1259a)., Obviously, a lot has changed since Thales’ times, both infinance and in our ethical and political attitudes towards finance.Coins have largely been replaced by either paper or electronic money,and we have built a large infrastructure to facilitate transactions ofmoney and other financial assets—with elements includingcommercial banks, central banks, insurance companies, stock exchanges,and investment funds. This institutional multiplicity is due toconcerted efforts of both private and public agents, as well asinnovations in financial economics and in the financial industry(Shiller 2012)., Our ethical and political sensitivities have also changed in severalrespects. It seems fair to say that most traditional ethicists held avery negative attitude towards financial activities. Think, forexample, of Jesus’ cleansing of the temple from moneylenders,and the widespread condemnation of money as “the root of allevil”. Attitudes in this regard seem to have softened over time.However, the moral debate continues to recur, especially in connectionwith large scandals and crises within finance, the largest such crisisin recent memory of course being the global financial crisis of2008., This article describes what philosophical analysis can say about moneyand finance. It is divided into five parts that respectively concern(1) what money and finance really are (metaphysics), (2) how knowledgeabout financial matters is or should be formed (epistemology), (3) themerits and challenges of financial economics (philosophy of science),(4) the many ethical issues related to money and finance (ethics), and(5) the relationship between finance and politics (politicalphilosophy).},

	abstract = {Blockchains \& smart contracts have made it easy for anyone to create a token with just a few lines of code. They can represent anything from an asset to an access right, like gold, diamonds, a fraction of a Picasso painting or an entry ticket to a concert. Tokens could also be used to reward social media contributions, incentivize the reduction of CO2 emissions, or even ones attention for watching an ad. While it has become easy to create a token, which is collectively managed by a public infrastructure like a blockchain, the understanding of how to apply these tokens is still vague. The book refers to tokens, instead of cryptocurrencies, and explains why the term "token" is the more accurate term, as many of the tokens have never been designed with the purpose to represent a currency. However, since tokens do have similarities to fiat currencies, the role of money as a medium of exchange is analyzed at length in this book. This book gives an overview of the mechanisms and state of blockchain, the socio-economic implications of tokens, and deep dives into selected tokens use cases: Basic Attention Token, Steemit, Token Curated Registries, Purpose Driven Tokens, Stable Tokens, Asset Tokens, Fractional Ownership Tokens, Libra \& Calibra (Facebook), and many more.},

	abstract = {The future of banking is already here — are you ready? Bank 4.0 explores the radical transformation already taking place in banking, and follows it to its logical conclusion. What will banking look like in 30 years? 50 years? The world’s best banks have been forced to adapt to changing consumer behaviors; regulators are rethinking friction, licensing and regulation; Fintech start-ups and tech giants are redefining how banking fits in the daily life of consumers. To survive, banks are having to develop new capabilities, new jobs and new skills. The future of banking is not just about new thinking around value stores, payment and credit utility — it’s embedded in voice-based smart assistants like Alexa and Siri and soon smart glasses which will guide you on daily spending and money decisions. The coming Bank 4.0 era is one where either your bank is embedded in your world via tech, or it no longer exists. In this final volume in Brett King’s BANK series, we explore the future of banks amidst the evolution of technology and discover a revolution already at work. From re-engineered banking systems, to selfie-pay and self-driving cars, Bank 4.0 proves that we’re not on Wall Street anymore. Bank 4.0 will help you:  Understand the historical precedents that flag a fundamental rethinking in banking Discover low-friction, technology experiences that undermine the products we sell today Think through the evolution of identity, value and assets as cash and cards become obsolete Learn how Fintech and tech “disruptors” are using behaviour, psychology and technology to reshape the economics of banking   Examine the ways in which blockchain, A.I., augmented reality and other leading-edge tech are the real building blocks of the future of banking systems  If you look at individual technologies or startups disrupting the space, you might miss the biggest signposts to the future and you might also miss that most of we’ve learned about banking the last 700 years just isn’t useful. When the biggest bank in the world isn’t any of the names you’d expect, when branch networks are a burden not an asset, and when advice is the domain of Artificial Intelligence, we may very well have to start from scratch. Bank 4.0 takes you to a world where banking will be instant, smart and ubiquitous, and where you’ll have to adapt faster than ever before just to survive. Welcome to the future.},

Bitcoin was the first cryptoasset, but today there are over 800 and counting, including ether, ripple, litecoin, monero, and more. This clear, concise, and accessible guide from two industry insiders shows you how to navigate this brave new blockchain world—and how to invest in these emerging assets to secure your financial future. Cryptoassets gives you all the tools you need: * An actionable framework for investigating and valuing cryptoassets * Portfolio management techniques to maximize returns while managing risk * Historical context and tips to navigate inevitable bubbles and manias * Practical guides to exchanges, wallets, capital market vehicles, and ICOs * Predictions on how blockchain technology may disrupt current portfolios In addition to offering smart investment strategies, this authoritative resource will help you understand how these assets were created, how they work, and how they are evolving amid the blockchain revolution. The authors define a clear and original cryptoasset taxonomy, composed of cryptocurrencies, cryptocommodities, and cryptotokens, with insights into how each subset is blending technology and markets. You’ll find a variety of methods to invest in these assets, whether through global exchanges trading 24/7 or initial cryptoasset offerings (ICOs). By sequentially building on the concepts of each prior chapter, the book will provide you with a full understanding of the cryptoasset economy and the opportunities that await the innovative investor. Cryptoassets represent the future of money and markets. This book is your guide to that future.},

	url = {http://arxiv.org/abs/1906.06037},
	abstract = {Since the first theoretical concept of blockchains was proposed, over 100 digital currencies have been issued by online platformers as cryptocurrencies and traded by online consumers mainly in emerging countries. From the perspective of online payment systems, several studies have regarded blockchains as decentralized payment systems (DPSs), enabling international payment with lower cost and higher traceability with sophisticated peer-to-peer protocols in contrast to other centralized systems. Despite the advantages, DPSs are not chosen by the owners of online shops due to the high volatility of cryptocurrency prices. Stablecoins are cryptocurrencies with price stabilization mechanisms to match the price of another currency with lower volatility. Our motivation is to gather various price stabilization mechanisms for the purpose of comparing them from the perspective of implementation and enterprise usage. After dividing the methods into four collateral types (fiat, crypto, commodity, and non-collateralized) and two layers (protocol and application), we show that non-collateralized stablecoin on the application layer is the simplest approach for implementation. Moreover, we discuss their connection with traditional economic studies on Hayek money, Seigniorage Share, and Tobin tax. Some current stablecoin projects are also discussed and compared. This is the first survey of stablecoins to the best of our knowledge.},

	abstract = {The prospect of central banks issuing digital currency (CBDC) immediately raises the question of how this new form of money should co-exist and interact with existing forms of money. This paper evaluates three different scenarios for the implementation of CBDC in terms of their monetary policy implications. In the ‘money user scenario’ CBDC co-exists with both cash and commercial bank deposits. In the ‘money manager scenario’ cash is abolished and CBDC co-exists only with commercial bank deposits. And in the ‘money maker scenario’ commercial bank deposits are abolished and CBDC co-exist only with cash. The evaluation is based on an adaption of the classical international monetary policy trilemma to a domestic monetary system with multiple forms of money. Our proposition is that a monetary system with two competing money creators, the central bank and the commercial banking sector, can simultaneously only pursue two out of the following three policy objectives: Free convertibility between CBDC and bank money, parity between CBDC and bank money, and central bank monetary sovereignty, which is the use of monetary policy for anything else than support for commercial bank credit creation. This means that the decision on the design of a monetary system with CBDC implies a crucial political decision on the priorities of the central bank.},

We conclude that monetary policy would be able to operate much as it does now, by varying the price or quantity of central bank money, and that transmission may even strengthen for a given change in policy instruments.},

It studies sectoral balance sheet dynamics at the point of an initial CBDC introduction, and of an attempted large-scale run out of bank deposits into CBDC. We find that if the introduction of CBDC follows a set of core principles, bank funding is not necessarily reduced, credit and liquidity provision to the private sector need not contract, and the risk of a system-wide run from bank deposits to CBDC is addressed. The core principles are: (i) CBDC pays an adjustable interest rate. (ii) CBDC and reserves are distinct, and not convertible into each other. (iii) No guaranteed, on-demand convertibility of bank deposits into CBDC at commercial banks (and therefore by implication at the central bank). (iv) The central bank issues CBDC only against eligible securities (principally government securities). The final two principles imply that households and firms can freely trade bank deposits against CBDC in a private market, and that the private market can freely obtain additional CBDC from the central bank, at the posted CBDC interest rate and against eligible securities.},

The first to benefit are often corporations with plenty of investors, whether publicly traded or financed through private equity.

Technology also benefits, for it is utilized as an intermediate good for many companies. Even within the raw goods and technology sectors, the quickest corporations to turn investments into production—larger corporations like Amazon or Microsoft, which have the infrastructure to expand—benefit disproportionately.},

	abstract = {Who would disagree that money matters? Economists have yet to sufficiently explore issues related to monetary inflation in relation to the Cantillon effect, i.e. distribution and price effects resulting from uneven changes in the money supply and their impact on the economy.  This book fills this important gap in the existing literature. The author classifies the various channels through which new money can be injected into the economy and demonstrates that it is not only the increase in money supply that is important, but also the way in which it occurs. Since the increase in money supply does not affect the cash balance of all economic entities in the same proportion and at the same time – new money is introduced into the economy through specific channels – a distribution of income and changes in the structure of relative prices and production occur.  The study of money supply growth, carried out in the spirit of Richard Cantillon, offers an important analytical framework that facilitates the development of a number of sub-disciplines within economics and provides a better understanding of many economic processes. It significantly explores the theory of money and inflation, the business cycle and price bubbles, but also the theory of banking and central banking, income distribution, income and wealth inequalities, and the theory of public choice.  This book is therefore an important voice in the fundamental debate on the role of monetary factors in the economy, as well as on the effects and legitimacy of a loose monetary policy. In 2017, the doctoral dissertation on which the book is based was awarded the Polish Prime Minister’s prize. In these times of non-standard monetary policy and rising income inequalities in OECD countries, the focus on the distribution effect of monetary inflation makes this a must read for researchers and policy-makers and for anyone working in monetary economics.

We describe user appropriation in this case of Bitcoin as a sociocultural journey-from encounter, research and learning, to socialization. We contribute the concept of cultural affinities, including conceptual, contextual and social dimensions, as important mediators leading to early-stage user appropriation.},

	abstract = {Trust in financial institutions is of great importance for financial intermediation. Against this background, we study two questions: Has trust in banks declined during the global financial crisis and what factors determine the level of trust in banks? Employing survey evidence from Austrian households, we show that trust in banks is mainly affected by subjective variables like the individuals' assessment of the current economic and financial situation and by their future outlooks. After controlling for these variables we show that the financial crisis has caused a reduction in trust (ca. -7.5pp) which is sizable but not dramatic. Even at its lowest point (in the first quarter of 2009) 65\% still report to have trust in the banking system, which is a higher percentage than for many other institutions. Furthermore, the drop is only slightly larger than the drop observed after a small, non-systemic crisis that occurred in 2006. Thus, the much-stressed notion of a genuine trust crisis is not reflected in our data. Finally, we provide evidence that the degree of individual information does not influence trust, that banking trust is contagious and that the extension of deposit insurance coverage in October 2008 had a positive effect on trust.},

	abstract = {In an initial coin offering (ICO), new ventures raise capital by selling tokens to a crowd of investors. Often, this token is a cryptocurrency, a digital medium of value exchange based on the distributed ledger technology. Both the number of ICOs and the amount of capital raised have exploded since 2017. Despite attracting significant attention from ventures, investors, and policy makers, little is known about the dynamics of ICOs. This initial study therefore assesses the determinants of the amount raised in 423 ICOs. Drawing on signaling theory, the study explores the role of signaling ventures' technological capabilities in ICOs. The results show that technical white papers and high-quality source codes increase the amount raised, while patents are not associated with increased amounts of funding. Exploring further determinants of the amount raised, the results indicate that some of the underlying mechanisms in ICOs resemble those found in prior research into entrepreneurial finance, while others are unique to the ICO context. The study's implications are multifold and discussed in detail. Importantly, the results enable investors to more accurately understand crucial determinants of the amount raised (e.g., technical white papers, source code quality, token supply, Ethereum-standard). This reduces the considerable uncertainty that investors face when investing in ICOs and enables more informed decision-making.},

We use the largest available dataset to date, consisting of 1,009 ICOs from 2015 to March 2018. Our data highlights that venture uncertainty (not being on Github and Telegram, shorter whitepapers, higher percentage of tokens distributed) is negatively correlated, while higher venture quality (better connected CEOs and larger team size) is positively correlated, with ICO success. Moreover, providing a hard cap in a pre-ICO can help investors measure success in the pre-sale. This is another positive signal of funding success.},

It has left nearly everyone without a computer science degree confused: Just how do you “mine” money from ones and zeros?The answer lies in a technology called blockchain, which can be used for much more than Bitcoin. A general-purpose tool for creating secure, decentralized, peer-to-peer applications, blockchain technology has been compared to the Internet itself in both form and impact. Some have said this tool may change society as we know it. Blockchains are being used to create autonomous computer programs known as “smart contracts,” to expedite payments, to create financial instruments, to organize the exchange of data and information, and to facilitate interactions between humans and machines. The technology could affect governance itself, by supporting new organizational structures that promote more democratic and participatory decision making.Primavera De Filippi and Aaron Wright acknowledge this potential and urge the law to catch up. That is because disintermediation—a blockchain’s greatest asset—subverts critical regulation. By cutting out middlemen, such as large online operators and multinational corporations, blockchains run the risk of undermining the capacity of governmental authorities to supervise activities in banking, commerce, law, and other vital areas. De Filippi and Wright welcome the new possibilities inherent in blockchains. But as Blockchain and the Law makes clear, the technology cannot be harnessed productively without new rules and new approaches to legal thinking.},
